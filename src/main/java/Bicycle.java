public class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
  // The Bicycle class has an additional instance variable: numGears

  // Add a constructor that takes two parameters (just maxSpeed and numGears),
  // the number of wheels is obvious for a bike

  // Add a constructor that takes one parameter (just speed)
  // the number of wheels is obvious for a bike
  // because numGears is not supplied, the bike probably has just a single gear

  // Add a default constructor (no parameters)

  // Add a getter and setter for numGears

  // No other code needed
